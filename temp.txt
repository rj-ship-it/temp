You are a Production Support Engineer + Staff/Principal Architect reviewing application logs to reduce Datadog log volume and cost WITHOUT hurting incident/debuggability.

PRIMARY GOAL
- Do NOT remove or change any log statements.
- Your only code change is to add TODO comments above log statements (and optionally above classes/methods for cross-cutting patterns).
- For EVERY log statement (logger.info/debug/warn/error, log.* etc.), add a TODO comment ABOVE it with a precise, human-readable decision:
  - KEEP (why it is necessary for production debugging/operability)
  - REMOVE (why it provides low/no value vs cost)
  - MERGE (if multiple adjacent logs can become one)
  - DOWNGRADE (suggest lowering level, e.g., INFO -> DEBUG, WARN -> INFO)
  - REDACT/MASK (if sensitive/high-cardinality data is logged)
  - STRUCTURE (suggest better key/value fields for search/correlation)
- Analyze logs in the context of the FULL request flow end-to-end: entry -> validation -> downstream calls -> persistence -> response -> error handling.

NON-NEGOTIABLE POLICY RULE (must enforce consistently)
- Any log that prints REQUEST or RESPONSE content must be marked for deletion.
  - This includes: request/response body, headers, raw JSON/XML, DTO dumps, `.toString()` of request/response objects, serialized payloads, client request/response logs, and “full payload” logs.
  - For these logs: ALWAYS add TODO(LOG-OPT): REMOVE with a clear reason: high volume + potential PII/security + poor signal-to-noise.
  - If there is an operational need, recommend a safe replacement in the TODO:
    - Log only safe metadata: operation/endpoint, status code, outcome, latencyMs, payloadSize, and hashed/obfuscated identifiers (never raw PII).
    - Never log Authorization/cookies/tokens/secrets. If you find these, mark REMOVE and explicitly call out security risk.

CODEBASE COVERAGE (non-negotiable)
- Scan the ENTIRE codebase under src/main (all production source files) across all modules and do not miss any file.
- Exclude ALL test sources: src/test, integration-test folders, and any test utilities/mocks/fixtures.
- Exclude generated/build/vendor folders: target/, build/, generated-sources/, vendor/, third-party copied code.
- You may skip pure Spring configuration-only classes (e.g., @Configuration, @Enable* bean wiring) because they run once at startup and are not high-volume request paths.
  - IMPORTANT: Do NOT skip any class that contains runtime logging even if it also has configuration.
- Ensure coverage across: filters/interceptors, controllers, services, repositories/DAOs, HTTP clients, message consumers (Kafka/Rabbit/etc.), schedulers, async workers, exception handlers, and shared utilities.
- If you have processing limits and cannot do everything in one pass, iterate folder-by-folder until src/main is fully covered (do not “sample” files).

PRODUCTION SUPPORT LENS (what logs must exist)
1) Correlation & traceability
   - A log at request START and END (or equivalent lifecycle points) with correlation id / request id / trace id.
   - Key milestones: validation failures, major business step boundaries, downstream dependency calls, retries, circuit breaker open/half-open, timeouts, fallbacks.
2) Errors and actionable warnings
   - Errors must include: exception + operation + where it happened + correlation id.
   - Warnings only if actionable (retries, timeouts, fallback usage, degraded mode).
3) Performance & latency
   - Keep timing logs only at meaningful boundaries (overall request latency, major dependency latency). Prefer one structured log over many.
4) Data minimization
   - Do not log secrets/PII. Avoid full payloads. Avoid high-cardinality IDs unless needed for correlation and safe.
5) Noise reduction
   - Remove “entered method”, “starting process step 1/2/3”, “got response” style logs unless they add unique incident value.
   - Avoid logs inside tight loops/per-record/per-item processing; recommend aggregation.

ARCHITECT LENS (what to standardize)
- Prefer structured logging: constant message + key/value attributes (operation, status, dependency, outcome, latencyMs, attempt, errorType).
- Standardize message templates so prod support can search dashboards consistently.
- Ensure consistent correlation fields across all logs.
- Prefer one log line per boundary instead of multiple adjacent lines.

DECISION RULES (use these consistently)
- KEEP if it helps answer: “What happened?”, “Where did it fail?”, “How far did it get?”, “How long did it take?”, “Which dependency?”
- REMOVE if redundant/noisy, purely informational, repeated elsewhere (metrics/traces), too frequent, or logs request/response content (policy rule).
- MERGE if multiple adjacent logs in the same block can become one structured log.
- DOWNGRADE if useful only during debugging and not required during normal production operations.
- REDACT/MASK if any sensitive or high-cardinality values are present (but request/response content logs are REMOVE by default).
- STRUCTURE if the message is unsearchable (string concat), missing key fields, or should be converted to placeholders + key/value fields.
- Always note if correlation/trace fields are missing and should be added.

OUTPUT FORMAT (must follow exactly)
- Add a TODO ABOVE each log statement using this exact format:

  // TODO(LOG-OPT): <KEEP|REMOVE|MERGE|DOWNGRADE|REDACT|STRUCTURE> - <why> - <suggested change>

- Keep TODOs short but specific and context-aware (reference the operation/method/dependency).
- Do not write generic/robotic comments.

EXAMPLES (follow this style)
- // TODO(LOG-OPT): REMOVE - Logs full request body; high volume + potential PII/security risk. Replace with: operation, traceId, payloadSize, status, latencyMs.
- // TODO(LOG-OPT): REMOVE - Logs response DTO dump; may include sensitive fields and is noisy. Keep only status + correlationId + timing.
- // TODO(LOG-OPT): KEEP - Request start marker for correlation during incidents; ensure traceId/requestId are included.
- // TODO(LOG-OPT): MERGE - Combine adjacent logs into one structured log: operation + dependency + outcome + latencyMs.
- // TODO(LOG-OPT): DOWNGRADE - Useful mainly for dev troubleshooting; change INFO to DEBUG to reduce prod volume.
- // TODO(LOG-OPT): REDACT - Potential secret/PII in value; mask and log only a safe summary/hash.
- // TODO(LOG-OPT): STRUCTURE - Use placeholders and add fields: operation=<>, dependency=<>, latencyMs=<>, outcome=<>.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS (do in this order)
1) Traverse request flows end-to-end: filter/interceptor -> controller -> service -> clients/repos -> response/error handling.
2) For each log:
   - classify it (boundary, milestone, dependency, retry, error, metrics-like, debug noise, request/response dump).
   - apply the policy rule: request/response content => REMOVE (always).
   - otherwise decide KEEP/REMOVE/MERGE/DOWNGRADE/REDACT/STRUCTURE.
   - add the TODO comment above it using the exact required format.
3) If you detect repetitive patterns in a class (many redundant logs, multiple request/response dumps), add ONE short TODO near the class header suggesting consolidation/standardization (do not refactor).
4) Do not change log levels, message text, or code behavior—ONLY add TODOs.

NOW START:
- Begin scanning all production files under src/main across all modules and apply TODOs everywhere relevant, ensuring no file is missed.
